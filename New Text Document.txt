Detail-oriented, a 'get-it-done' spirit, and proactive - these are the perfect words when it comes to my full-stack development journey. I am passionate about building user-centric products. I learn things proactively with curiosity. Like all of us, I have my weaknesses, which I address with positivity and take as learning opportunities.   

** What I am looking for? ** 
An opportunity to work within an enthusiastic team with ample chances to increase professional development. I am hungry to learn and take myself to the top of the game. 

** What can I bring? ** 
Who doesn't want an energetic colleague who is ready to challenge herself! I have been to top-notch universities to study engineering, collaborated with multicultural teams. These made me able to learn fast and perform. 

** Tech Skills ** 
Skilled in building web applications using JavaScript, React js, Bootstrap, CSS, Express.js, Git, HTML, MongoDB, and Node.js. Experienced in designing games using P5js, making responsive webpages/apps etc.


 I am passionate about creating new things - more specifically creating user-centric products. I left my engineering job because I knew I can do even better in software development
